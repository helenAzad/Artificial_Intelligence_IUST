# Artificial Intelligence and Expert Systems Projects

This repository contains various projects related to artificial intelligence at IUST, implemented as part of coursework. Each project focuses on a different AI/ML technique and provides comprehensive documentation, code, and results analysis.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

- `SVM/`: Contains the Support Vector Machine (SVM) project.
- `Neural-Network/`: Contains the Neural Network project.
- `Genetic/`: Contains the Genetic Programming project.
- `Decision Tree project/`: Contains the Decision Tree project.

Each directory includes its own `README.md` file with detailed information about the respective project.

## Projects Overview

### 1. SVM (Support Vector Machine)
- **Objective**: To familiarize with SVM classification capabilities.
- **Tasks**:
  - Design and classify simple to complex two-class problems.
  - Use the same dataset from the Neural Network project for classification.
  - Select a new dataset and perform classification using SVM.
- **Deliverables**: Code, test cases, and a comprehensive report.

### 2. Neural Network
- **Objective**: To understand multi-layer perceptron networks and their learning processes.
- **Tasks**:
  - Use a pre-existing dataset to test an MLP model.
  - Approximate several one-dimensional functions using an MLP.
  - Introduce noise into the data and observe the network’s performance.
  - Use MLP for classification on a chosen dataset.
  - Apply MLP for noise reduction on the same dataset.
- **Deliverables**: Code, visualizations, and detailed analysis.

### 3. Genetic Programming
- **Objective**: To approximate functions using genetic programming.
- **Tasks**:
  - Approximate a function given a set of data points.
  - Experiment with various operators and assess the impact of discontinuities.
  - Evaluate performance across multiple trials.
- **Deliverables**: Code, results of experiments, and a report detailing findings and challenges.

### 4. Decision Tree
- **Objective**: To classify datasets using decision trees.
- **Tasks**:
  - Use a dataset to train and test a decision tree.
  - Compare the performance of the decision tree with other models.
  - Analyze the impact of different parameters on the tree’s performance.
- **Deliverables**: Code, performance comparisons, and a detailed report.
