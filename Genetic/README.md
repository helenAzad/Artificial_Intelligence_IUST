# Function Approximation using Genetic Programming (GP)

This project focuses on approximating a function using Genetic Programming (GP). The goal is to evaluate the understanding of basic concepts of evolutionary algorithms, particularly Genetic Programming.

## Project Objective

- To demonstrate proficiency in the basic concepts of evolutionary algorithms through the implementation of Genetic Programming.
- To use GP for function approximation where each individual in the population represents a mathematical expression in the form of a tree.

## Project Overview

### Description

In this project, the aim is to approximate an unknown function using Genetic Programming. Each individual in the GP population is represented as a tree with mathematical expressions. The internal nodes of the tree are operators (e.g., +, -, *, /, ^, Sin, Cos), and the leaf nodes are constants or input variables. The objective is to estimate the mathematical formula of a target function, which is a black box, meaning we can only compute its value at given points.

### Inputs and Outputs

- **Inputs**: A set of training points and their corresponding target function values.
- **Outputs**: The mathematical formula of the best tree generated by the algorithm, its fitness value, the number of generations, the number of fitness evaluations, runtime, and progress graphs.

## Key Features

1. **Operators**:
    - Binary: +, -, *, /, ^ (power)
    - Unary: Sin(x), Cos(x)

2. **GP Process**:
    - **Initialization**: Generate an initial population of random mathematical expressions.
    - **Fitness Evaluation**: Evaluate the fitness of each individual based on the difference between the predicted and actual function values at the training points.
    - **Selection**: Select parents based on fitness to produce offspring.
    - **Crossover and Mutation**: Apply crossover and mutation operators to generate new individuals.
    - **Termination**: The algorithm stops when a predefined condition is met (e.g., maximum number of generations or a satisfactory fitness level).

3. **Additional Tests**:
    - Test cases where the target function includes operators not available in the GP implementation.
    - Test cases with discontinuities in the target function.

4. **Multi-dimensional Functions**:
    - Extend the algorithm to handle functions with more than one input variable (at least two dimensions).

5. **Mutation Impact**:
    - Analyze the impact of mutation in each generation and develop a dynamic algorithm to adapt mutation rates based on conditions like stagnant Mean Squared Error (MSE).

6. **Progress Tracking**:
    - Plot graphs showing the best fitness value in each generation and the MSE of the entire population.
